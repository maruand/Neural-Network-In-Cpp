## Project Description

This project is a modular neural network implementation in C++ designed for educational and experimental purposes. It provides core components for building, training, and evaluating neural networks, including layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions. The project aims to demonstrate machine learning concepts through practical examples, such as predicting housing prices from CSV data. It is structured for extensibility and ease of integration with other C++ projects, and leverages the Eigen library for efficient matrix operations.

Key features:
- Customizable neural network architecture
- Support for various activation and loss functions
- Optimizer implementations
- Example workflow for regression tasks (e.g., housing price prediction)
- CSV data reading and preprocessing

See the TODO section below for planned improvements and examples.
